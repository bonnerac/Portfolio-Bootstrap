# Portfolio-Bootstrap

## Desciption

Recreating the original portfolio site using Bootstrap, responsive images, and a responsive layout.

## Goals

This site is designed to showcase someone's professional portfolio on desktop, tablets, and mobile phones. It includes the following pages:

* **About** section - To introduce this person to visitors of the site, especially professionals in a similar or related industry
* **Portfolio** section - To showcase this person's work to potential employers, or anyone with an interest in the subject
* **Contact** section - To allow any of the website's visitors to contact this person directly, especially for inquiring about employment or freelancing opportunities

## Complications

During the process of making this responsive site, I did run into some problems: 

* Making the site look exactly like the original.
    * I tried really hard to use almost no CSS in this assignment, and it probably would have been a better choice to use more. I think I got all of the elements on the page, but I struggled to make it match the original exactly.
* Struggled going back and forth with creating my own nav bar using rows/columns and using a pre-built nav bar from Bootstrap. I Finally was able to get the rows/columns to work with some help.
* Used prebuilt Bootstrap components for the pictures/text on the **Portfolio** page. The page is nice and responsive, but looks a little different from the original. I couldn't figure out how to get the size of the pictures to be smaller for the larger view. While this one lacks the clean look of the original, it does scale down to mobile well.


## Other Thoughts

You may have noticed that this is a professional portfolio site for Scrooge McDuck. I picked Mr. McDuck because he is a very interesting individual, yet he has no professional portfolio website that I could find on the internet. He especially does not have one that works on tablets and mobile as well. I figured he could use one. This lack of internet presence is most likely due to the fact that he is a duck as well as a fictional character.
